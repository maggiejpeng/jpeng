        <p>I was the kid who annoyed the shit out of everyone because I would never stop asking why. My teacher from pre-k to college can attest to that, and in many ways I'm still that kid. Now I also love doing what Malcom Gladwell calls, "connecting the dots," solving problems by asking good questions that clarify reality and identify the common thread in situations, cultures, personalities and problems.</p>

            <p>I was the kid who annoyed the shit out of everyone because I would never stop asking why. My teacher from pre-k to college can attest to that, and in many ways I'm still that kid. Now I also love doing what Malcom Gladwell calls, "connecting the dots," solving problems by asking good questions that clarify reality and identify the common thread in situations, cultures, personalities and problems.</p>
            <p>Born in Szechuan (yes the word synonymous with spicy on Chinese menu), bred in Shanghai, I spent my formative years of high school in Connecticut daydreaming a lot, debating ideas to and fro classes and that freedom made me a malleable, adaptable and unapologetic questioner. I chose my major by process of elimination and there was only one option left, advertising. As a cosmopolitan, the diversity of my experience has always pushed me to always try harder to understand the other side. I learned the necessity of fostering a nuanced curiosity for people and culture, and the same goes when I conduct research as a strategist or go about solving business/human problems when they're not readily relatable.</p>
            <p>I'm currently a first-time cat mom, taking care of two kitties for my friend.</p>
